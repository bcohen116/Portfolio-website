        <p>At CGI, I had plenty of opportunities to grow both technically and professionally. </p>
        <br>
        <p>CGI is constantly trying to be a leader and an <b>innovator</b> in its industry. Because of this, I was able to take part in significant projects involving technologies and processes like <b>Bluetooth Low Energy, rapid prototyping, Android, Python, and more.</b> This co-op position was challenging in the technical respect, and I really enjoyed being able to <b>research</b> solutions and see a project from start to finish.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Professionally, I also was able to grow from this position. Throughout my time there, I had opportunities to take trainings, and talk to experts about how to improve my career. The most important aspect that was often brought up is about <b>problem solving</b>. When solving a problem, often engineers will just think about the solution that solves the initial problem. However, there are way more factors to consider. I learned that <b>feedback</b> is very important; Information from both executives, and the consumer, are both needed for a successful solution. The most important aspect of all is that even with a good solution, there still needs to be a way to <b>make money</b>. If a product cannot make money, then there is no way it will succeed. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I loved my time at CGI. My knowledge base as well as my personal skills were improved vastly. I think my values fit well into the company. </p>

        <p>At CIMx Software, I had a great opportunity to grow. The company is very small (less than 20 employees), which really allowed me to take <b>initiative</b> and take on more <b>responsibilities</b>. This was my first technical related job, so I really learned a lot about how to adjust to work life compared to being in school. This company relies heavily on Agile and <b>team</b> based work, which I really enjoyed. The team based aspect allowed me to <b>collaborate</b>, and expand my knowledge into new fields I was unfamiliar with. This allowed me to become more <b>teachable</b> which has been an extremely valuable skill in my career so far.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was also able to expand my coding skills from this position. Running a <b>Full Stack</b> system, I was able to work with the development team to test and develop new features for their web application. Being a small company, there were not enough people around to have a full <b>quality assurance</b> team, or a full any kind of team. This allowed me to have significant input into development, and I was able to take on increased roles as my time there increased. I was also able to learn about automated testing, and the QA field. I spent a significant amount of time conducting <b>testing</b>, writing automated tests, and fixing bugs. I really enjoyed that because it provided an interesting challenge that was different every day. </p>
